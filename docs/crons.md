# Cron Jobs

Configure these cron jobs in OpenClaw after completing `docs/setup.md`.

Use `openclaw cron add` or edit the crons section in `~/.openclaw/openclaw.json`.

> **Tip:** Set all times in your local timezone using the `tz` field. Adjust to match your work schedule.

## Notes

- **`sessionTarget: isolated`** is mandatory for all crons — shared sessions remember previous runs and may skip work thinking it's already done.
- **`model: opus`** for meeting-prep, action-items, and digest — these require deep reasoning and extraction quality. Use `sonnet` only for lightweight tasks (token refresh, health checks).
- **`thinking: high`** improves extraction and classification quality.
- All skill paths use `~/hypergrowth-skills/` absolute references so they work correctly from isolated cron sessions regardless of working directory.
